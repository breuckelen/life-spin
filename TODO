# How to find multiple assertion violations
    * Save previous states in error and assert that the initial board is new
    or use spins traces to look for something that is not that
    * Start with initial states that we know end up in certain configurations,
    assert that those configurations arise
    * Figure out how to constrain squares on the board, come up with different
    processes to constrain in different ways
# Add
    * d_steps to force spin to combine actions
    * combine into 1-2 processes
    * change buffer into a local variable
    * depth of violations below 250
